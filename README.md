ProjectMetricSlack
==================

For assessing Slack activity using the gini coefficient.

Required Configuration Variable
-------------------------------

- token: API token.
- channel: Name of the slack channel that is measured.

TODO 

* [x] vcr setup into a different file
* [ ] remove memoization?
* [ ] DRY out to inject with indices
* [ ] can we make fewer queries - i.e. to channels directly
